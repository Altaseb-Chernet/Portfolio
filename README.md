# Altaseb-Chernet — Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio. This repository contains a modern, responsive portfolio site built primarily with JavaScript, with supporting CSS and HTML. It showcases projects, skills, and contact information and is designed to be easy to deploy (for example, on GitHub Pages or any static hosting).

## Demo
https://altaseb-chernet.verce.app

## Features
- Clean, responsive layout optimized for desktop and mobile
- Project gallery with links, descriptions, and tech used
- Interactive UI elements built with JavaScript
- Contact section (email or contact form integration)
- Easy static deployment (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Surge, etc.)

## Tech stack
- JavaScript (~95% of codebase)
- CSS for styling and responsive layout
- React for structure

## Getting started (local development)
These are generic instructions — adjust them to your setup if you use a bundler or framework.

1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/Altaseb-Chernet/Portfolio.git
2. Open the project
   cd Portfolio
3. Serve locally
   - Option A — Open index.html directly in your browser
   - Option B — Use a simple local server:
     - With Node (http-server): npx http-server -c-1
     - With VS Code Live Server: right-click index.html -> Open with Live Server

If you have npm scripts (for example, a bundler or tooling), run:
- npm install
- npm run dev
- npm run build

(If these scripts do not exist, the static site will work without them.)


## Deployment
Recommended options:
- GitHub Pages: Push to the `main` branch and enable Pages from repository settings (or use a `gh-pages` branch).
- Netlify/Vercel: Connect the repo and configure build (if any) or deploy as a static site.
- Surge: npm i -g surge && surge ./public

## Customization
- Replace placeholder content (name, bio, projects, images, links).
- Update colors and fonts in CSS to match your branding.
- Add analytics or contact form backend as needed.

## Contributing
This is a personal portfolio, so contributions are optional. If you want to suggest improvements:
1. Open an issue describing the change
2. Submit a PR with clear changes and screenshots if the UI is affected

## License
Add a license if you want others to reuse the code. Example: MIT (create a LICENSE file).
